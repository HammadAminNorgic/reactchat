## Setting up the local environment

To install React on your local system, you need the following:


**Node.js**

Angular requires an active LTS or maintenance LTS version of Node.js.
For more information on installing Node.js, see <a href="https://nodejs.org">nodejs.org</a>. If you are unsure what version of Node.js runs on your system, run node -v in a terminal window.

**npm package manager**

React applications depend <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/what-is-npm"> npm packages </a> on npm packages for many features and functions. To download and install npm packages, you need an npm package manager. This guide uses the npm client command line interface, which is installed with Node.js by default. To check that you have the npm client installed, run npm -v in a terminal window.You can also use yarn.
